Dependancies: MuseScore 3, Python 3

Input: Any number of Musescore (.mscz) files

How to run this program:
1. Move all of the .mscz files you want to process into the same directory as the "Musescore_Part_Splitter" folder.
2. Go into the "Musescore_Part_Splitter" folder, and double click the appropiate PartSplitter_Runner.py file. Choose the file that matches the version of MuseScore you installed, which largely depends on your operating system.
3. If needed, make any edits needed to the individual parts in the "mscz_Files" folder. Then, run the appropiate RedoPDFs file to automatically generate new .pdf files
